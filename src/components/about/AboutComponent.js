          HaveAll is an intermediary service developed by five students taking
          part in the iLab of the FH St. PÃ¶lten. The product is connecting
          mental health experts to employees. The therapy sessions can be given
          to the employees by their companies for free as a fringe benefit and
          can be booked easily via a booking system.
        </p>
        <p className='about__text-item'>
          The aim of the project was to find a solution which makes employees
          feel more appreciated for the work they do.
        </p>
